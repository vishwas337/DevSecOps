# End-to-End DevSecOps Pipeline for Spring PetClinic

This repository contains an end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline for the Spring PetClinic sample application, demonstrating automated security practices integrated into the software development lifecycle.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes the Spring PetClinic application, a well-known sample application built using Spring Boot. The pipeline automates the build, test, security scanning, and deployment processes, ensuring a secure and efficient delivery of the application.

**Spring PetClinic Description:**

The Spring PetClinic application is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer). This project uses it as a sample application to demonstrate a complete DevSecOps pipeline.

## Key Features of the DevSecOps Pipeline

* **Automated Build:** Uses Maven or Gradle to build the Spring PetClinic application.
* **Automated Unit and Integration Testing:** Executes comprehensive tests to ensure code quality.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrates tools like SonarQube or similar to perform static code analysis and identify security vulnerabilities.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Uses tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or similar to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Containerization:** Builds a Docker image of the application for consistent deployment.
* **Container Security Scanning:** Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy or similar.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Uses tools like Terraform or CloudFormation (if applicable) to provision and manage infrastructure.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implements a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar to automate the entire process.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** (Optional) Integrates DAST tools to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
* **Deployment:** Deploys the application to a target environment (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Implements monitoring and logging to track application performance and security events.

## Technologies Used

* **Spring Boot:** Application framework.
* **Maven/Gradle:** Build tools.
* **Docker:** Containerization.
* **GitHub Actions/Jenkins:** CI/CD.
* **SonarQube/Similar:** SAST.
* **OWASP Dependency-Check/Similar:** SCA.
* **Trivy/Similar:** Container security scanning.
* **Terraform/CloudFormation (Optional):** IaC.
* **Java 17+**

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vishwas337/DevSecOps.git](https://github.com/vishwas337/DevSecOps.git)
    cd DevSecOps
    ```

2.  **Build the application:**

    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install # or ./gradlew clean build
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    java -jar target/*.jar
    ```

4.  **Configure the CI/CD pipeline:**

    * Set up the necessary environment variables and credentials in your CI/CD tool.
    * Configure the pipeline to run the build, test, and security scanning steps.
    * Setup your target environment to deploy the docker image.

5.  **Run the pipeline:**

    * Trigger the pipeline to build and deploy the application.
    * Observe the results of the security scans and address any identified vulnerabilities.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement DAST for runtime security testing.
* Integrate more advanced security tools and practices.
* Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities.
* Implement automatic remediation of security vulnerabilities.
* Add more detailed documentation for each stage of the pipeline.
* Add Infrastructure as code to deploy to cloud environments.
